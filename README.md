# -Moodi-A Content Management Systems (CMS)


CMSs are used for managing what actually appears on your websiteâ€”what, when, where, how and by whom. A CMS is designed to allow non-technical staff with little or no programming skill to easily and quickly publish content to a website. Content is normally defined outside of the system (e.g. an HR policy or a news item) and the CMS is used to define the presentation of the content on the website. CMSs usually provide a range of features, including the capability to:
define workflows and approvals
archive old content
immediately publish directly to the site
contribute content directly into the CMS
define when content appears on the site
populate a database of all information on the site (i.e. a content repository or inventory)
facilitate site search functions, navigation and a site map
enforce site policy, standards, structure and design
automatically index and meta tag content with keywords
